# school_analysis_projects
This is a collection of statistical and data analysis projects I developed for a two-part upper level statistics course at the University of New Mexico.

The [primary project](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/school_analysis_projects/blob/main/ADA1finalreport.pdf) consists of a single large [Quarto](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/school_analysis_projects/blob/main/ADA1_ALL_Outline_RyanR_Class27.qmd) (markdown) file. The skeleton of this file was composed by the professor and distributed at the beginning of the course. Each part of the outline was then completed as an assignment.

Much of the data used to produce this project is unavailable, and though I've included both the R code and the markdown's html, make sure to see the [pdf](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/school_analysis_projects/blob/main/ADA1finalreport.pdf) for the actual output. Though the code may not run, it's filled with valuable tools for statistical analysis and data visualizations (tidyverse and Quarto) in R and provides a template for an academically rigorous Rmarkdown file.

Many thanks to [Dr. Erik Erhardt](https://statacumen.com/about/) at the University of New Mexico for this expansive and powerful toolkit!
