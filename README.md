# school_analysis_projects
This is a collection of statistical and data analysis projects I developed for a two-part upper level statistics course at the University of New Mexico.

The projects are collected in the form of two large Rmarkdown files. The skeleton of each file was distributed at the beginning of the course and versions were then saved with the completion of each individual project.

Much of the data used to produce these projects is unavailable, but I've included both the R code and the html file outputs. Though the code may not run, it's filled with valuable tools for statistical analysis and data visualizations (ggplot and Quarto in particular) in R.

Many thanks to [Dr. Erik Erhardt](https://statacumen.com/about/) at the University of New Mexico for this expansive toolkit!
